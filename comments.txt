This has been my first time using DOMDocument methods with PHP
In theory, when using the method getElementsByTagName (for example) I understood I should receive all the elements inside the source code
When testing I only received the elements under the <body> and none of the inside Nodes

After realizing that, I tried to obtain the elements <li> that contain the required information 
When trying to reach that path level, I was not getting the information that I was supposed to receive
During the development of the code, the website had an update of code and the associated class where the info was changed name to 'event_types/Show'

Until I realized that the received error of 0 nodes was because this, it took me a while.

Also I realized that what I was receiving from this node were not more nodes, but plain JSON string with the data
This also took me a bit to realize

After obtaining that JSON string, obtaining the required data was easy
